# LandRegistrationApp
A land registration app workflow would typically run as follows:

User registration: Users would first need to create an account by providing personal information, such as name, contact details, and proof of identity.

Property search: Users would then be able to search for properties by entering the property address or owner's name.

Property details: Users would be able to view detailed information about a property, including ownership history, deeds, and titles.

Property transfer: If a user wants to initiate a property transfer, they would need to submit the relevant documents and information, such as the sale agreement, land records, and proof of identity.

Smart contract execution: Smart contracts would then be executed to transfer the property title to the new owner.

Property registration: Users would be able to register a new property by submitting their land records, including deeds and titles.

Document upload: Users would be able to upload and view relevant documents, such as deeds and titles.

Notifications: Users would receive notifications about the status of their property registration or transfer requests.

Admin Approval: Admin would review the registration or transfer request, and approve or reject it as per the documents and information provided.

Property title updated: Once the admin approves the registration or transfer request, the property title would be updated on the blockchain.

Property ownership records: Users would be able to view their property ownership records on the app, and they can also check the property's ownership history.

This is a general workflow, and the specific steps and requirements of a land registration app will depend on the specific requirements and needs of the users, as well as the regulations and laws in the area where the app is being used.
